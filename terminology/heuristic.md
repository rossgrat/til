# Heuristic
A Heuristic is some solution to a problem that is "good enough". Heuristics can produce approximations and are not fully optimized. Heuristics are used when finding the optimal solution is impractical or impossible.

On the other hand, an algorithm is a procedure which always produces a correct result.
