# Rules of the Road
AI is a rapidly changing technology, and how I use it in the workplace will change with the technology. It is very tempting to use AI to go "faster", often at the expense of quality and my own skill. Below are some of my learnings (subject to change) that I believe help me get the most out of AI.

# DO
## Use AI to dig Deeper 
AI shines at very quickly taking in a lot of context, extracting information that you need from that context. However, if you don't understand the underlying content, you may fall victim to AI hallunications or subtle inconsistencies that can be problematic to build decisions off of.

**Read the base content first, then use AI to dig up missing information**

Read the Slack threads before using a Slack Agent to summarize the content, read the documentation before asking AI to extract what you need.

## Use AI as a reviwer
AI is pretty good at looking at what you have and checking your work. Given a whole codebase and a diff, it can catch bugs, typos, or missing logic in an implementation. 

**Figure out the problem, and even do the implementation yourself, use AI to find what you missed.**

## Use AI on clearly defined tickets and problems
Greating a new Grafana dasbhboard where the metrics are clearly defined. Implementing table tests with examples to work off of, and all cases laid out. Implementing REST endpoints with examples. These are all areas Claude shines. These tickets generally have limited scope, and are very clearly defined with all of the ambiguities worked out.

## Spend time thinking about problems
Using AI is like a slot machine, and for me has been very addictive. It is important to back away at some point, and just spend the time necessary to think about the problem.   

# DO NOT
## Outsource your thinking to AI
It is incredibly tempting to hookup Claude to a bunch of CLI tools and MCP servers, give it a ticket, and let it have at it. You could do this with many instances concurrently. AI isn't there yet. In my experience, context switching between different Claude instances is mentally exhausting, and after a short period, my brain turns off. It's just too much information, and my usage turns into using more Claude sessions to correct the other Claude sessions.

Not only does this take more time, probably longer than it would have it I just focused on doing one this at a time, it also results in a worse product, and atrophies the problem-solving and reasoning skills that are required for good engineering.

Multi-tasking is doing many things at once, badly.

**Think about one thing at a time**
