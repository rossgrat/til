# Problem Specification
The specification to a problem must provide:
1. The set of allowable input instances
2. The required characteristics of the output

A common technique in algorithm design is to restrict the input until some algorithm does exist for the problem. (I.e restrict graphs to trees, restrict two dimensions to one.
