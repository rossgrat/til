# Documentation Quick Links
These are some quick links to postgres documentation that I find myself using often.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html)
- [Roles and Privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-grant.html)
- [SELECT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-select.html)
