# Bucket Permission Policies
When creating an S3 bucket, a bucket policy, found under the permissions tab for the bucket, is necessary for defining how the objects in the bucket are accessed. Trying to access data in a bucket without this policy will result in errors, most often 403 "AccessDenied" errors.
