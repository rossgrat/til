# The Collector's Fallacy
In the past I have tried to create "toolboxes", where I deposit all the information I can. The idea being that as I learn things on the job, I'll accumulate knowledge over my career, and be able to reference it later. This has failed twice, and Claude tells me that the reason for my failures is due to the Collector's Fallacy - The trap of collecting information without a system for retrieval or a constraint on scope.

The recommended fix for this is the TIL pattern (popularized by Simon Willison?). Via plaintext editors and repository control, I will start dropping in short snippets of things I learned that I can later reference with `grep`.
